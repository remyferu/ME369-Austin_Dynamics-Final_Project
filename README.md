SETUP/HOW TO: 

please follow along with the instructions from this document (lightning talk code follow along):

Before clicking the link please keep in mind the name of the catking workspace you are creating. Instead of creating a lightning_talk workspace, create a final_project_wc workspace
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zF7FCS2k8OG_VFYPCMd8QHJgtybkvfCLmpAyR_oQRPE/edit?usp=sharing

Now create a package inside the workspace src folder for the model_mover.py file. Reference the link below for help: 
http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

Tell linux that the model_mover.py is an executable:
